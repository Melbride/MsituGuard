# UNEP Dataset Integration Plan for MsituGuard

## Successfully Downloaded Datasets:
- PM2.5 Air Pollution (World Bank)
- Urban Population (World Bank)
- Carbon Pricing Dashboard (World Bank)

## Integration Strategy:

### 1. Air Quality Enhancement (PM2.5 data):
```python
# Add to tree survival model
features += ['pm25_exposure']  # Air pollution affects tree health
# Higher PM2.5 → lower tree survival probability
```

### 2. Urbanization Pressure (Urban population data):
```python
# Add urbanization context
features += ['urban_pressure']  # Urban areas have different survival rates
# Higher urbanization → different planting success rates
```

### 3. Carbon Context (Carbon pricing data):
```python
# Add economic environmental value
features += ['carbon_value']  # Trees have carbon sequestration value
# Links tree survival to economic environmental benefits
```

### 4. Environmental Economics (Kenya Economic Survey):
```python
# Add national environmental context
features += ['env_investment']  # Government environmental spending
# Policy support affects tree planting success
```

## Enhanced Model Features:
```python
# Original 13 features + UNEP enhancements
enhanced_features = [
    # Original features
    'tree_species', 'rainfall_mm', 'temperature_c', 'altitude_m',
    'soil_ph', 'planting_season', 'care_level', 'water_source',
    
    # UNEP dataset enhancements
    'pm25_exposure',      # Air quality impact on trees
    'urban_pressure',     # Urbanization effects
    'carbon_value',       # Economic environmental value
    'env_policy_support'  # Government environmental investment
]
```

## UNEP Competition Positioning:
"MsituGuard integrates official UNEP-recommended datasets:
- World Bank air quality data → environmental health impact
- Urban population trends → development pressure analysis  
- Carbon pricing data → economic environmental valuation
- Kenya national environmental data → policy alignment

This creates a comprehensive environmental prediction model that addresses multiple UNEP sustainability metrics."

## Next Steps:
1. Process downloaded datasets
2. Extract relevant variables for tree survival
3. Integrate with existing model
4. Validate enhanced predictions
5. Document UNEP dataset usage for competition
